## Reporting issues

If you find an bug or want to suggest a feature or enhancement, please create an issue on this repository. Github is the only channel I'll monitor for this purpose. 

Before you create an issue about a bug, make sure it's not already in the Known Issues section. Please attach any relevant information you have, including Lua stacktraces, steps you took to trigger the bug and the list of other addons you use (I would be extra kind to narrow down that list by reproducing the bug with other addons disabled, in case the bug is caused by an incompatibility between Soulshape Journal and another addon).

## Translating the addon

Available translations:

* :us:/:uk: English by @christopheml
* :fr: French by @christopheml

If you want to contribute a new translation, please open a pull-request with the new translation added. 

The new locale file must contain all the keys from [enUS.lua](Localization/enUS.lua), which is the default locale. If a key doesn't need to be translated, set its value to `true`. If you need more information about how locales are handled in Soulshape Journal, please check [AceLocale's documentation](https://www.wowace.com/projects/ace3/pages/api/ace-locale-3-0?comment=1).

Your translation must be provided under a license compatible with the [MIT License](LICENSE.txt), ideally the MIT License itself, but some other copyleft licenses can work.
